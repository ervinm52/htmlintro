<title> About Me! </title>

<p>I like listening to <strong>music</strong>. I like all genres pretty much, but my top 3 would be: </p>
<ul>
	<li>electronic</li>
	<li>nu metal</li>
	<li>indie</li>
</ul>
Those are pretty big genres, but all pretty good!

<p>I also like <strong>videogames</strong>. <br> Nowadays I usually use a PC, but I used to play on console a lot when I was younger. Some games I like are: </p>
<ul>
	<li>VALORANT</li>
	<li>Minecraft</li>
	<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ul>
